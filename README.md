## This is todo 

todo is yet another todo list application, designed to work according to my personal preferences. It's goals are simple:

* Simply and cleanly mimic a todo list as kept in a paper book (like a Moleskine)
* Use the most current and consistent Ruby or Rails design principles
* Fully test all appropriate code (note: not 100% test coverage)

## License

todo is released under the MIT license and is copyright (c) 2012 Mike Karolow. A copy of the MIT license can be found in the LICENSE file.

## Installation and Setup

todo is a Ruby on rails application that should be usable by anyone. With that said, it is developed to my own specifications and without regard for general purpose installations. I welcome any feedback with the aim of supporting other installations.
